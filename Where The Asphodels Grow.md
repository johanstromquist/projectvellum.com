Where the Asphodels Grow
The ashes of the witch still clung beneath my fingernails when the world unmade itself.
I sat at the edge of the cliff, legs dangling over limestone that dropped straight to the sea. The sun rose behind me, casting my shadow long and thin across the water. Below, waves crashed against the rocks with a patience I envied – eternal, rhythmic, certain of their purpose. The cloth that had held her head lay empty beside me, stained dark with blood and other fluids I tried not to contemplate.
Three days since the burning. Three days of walking south from the massacre, away from the legion, away from the thing I had become. My sandals had worn through. My feet bled. It seemed fitting.
The morning wind carried salt and the memory of screams.
I had crushed her skull with a stone, there on the beach at dawn. Ground the bones to powder, mixed them with driftwood and dried kelp, set the whole thing ablaze. Even in death, she had fought – the fire burned green and silver, sparks flying against the wind toward the village we had emptied. When nothing remained but ash, I cast it into the waves and watched the sea swallow decades of corruption.
Or what I had thought was corruption.
The children's faces haunted me most. Not from the ritual years ago – those memories had scarred over, become bearable with time. No, these were fresh wounds. A boy, perhaps six summers old, still wearing his wooden mask as the light faded from his eyes. The mask was just a goat, crudely carved, probably made by his own small hands for the festival. When I pulled it from his face, he looked like my sister's son might have looked, had she lived to bear children.
Had I lived to see them.
“I am just a man,” I said to the wind, to the waves, to whatever gods might still be listening. A prayer or a plea or perhaps just a final truth before I let the rocks below decide my fate.
That's when the world... shifted.
 
The sensation was not unlike drowning, if drowning were possible in light itself. The cliff, the sea, the weight of three days without sleep – all of it became suddenly negotiable, as if reality had politely suggested it might exist rather than insisting upon the fact. I felt myself pulled inward and outward simultaneously, drawn through the hollow reed of my own existence into a space that was not space.
I stood without ground. Existed without form. The tattered remains of my robes clung to me like shame itself, and my hairless skin prickled with a cold that had nothing to do with temperature.
“You have been expected,” said the Aether, though said is wrong, and the Aether is wrong, and expected is both wrong and terrifyingly correct.
“I suppose this is madness, then.” My voice sounded strange here, echoing without walls to throw it back. “Good. I was growing tired of sanity.”
“Sanity and madness are matters of perspective. You are between perspectives now.”
“Between.” I almost laughed. “Yes, that sounds right. Between man and monster. Between duty and atrocity. Between the living and the dead I create.” The words tasted bitter, even in this place without taste.
“Tell me of the first time.”
 
The first time. As if there were only one beginning to this curse. But I understood what it wanted – not the first death, but the first moment I became something other than human.
“I was twenty-seven summers,” I began, and even here in this nowhere place, I could smell the asphodels. “A lictor to the king of a village so small it had no name beyond the hills. We called it Thynaria, after the wild thyme that grew on the hillsides. It sat on a crest above the sea, caught between the water and the necropolis carved into the far cliffs.”
The memories came easier than they should have, as if this place drew them out like poison from a wound.
“The Romans – though they weren't Romans then, just another tribe fleeing the northern raids – came in winter. Forty-three survivors, their crude carts barely holding together, their faces hollow with hunger. We fed them from our stores, gave them shelter in the lower caves. The king commanded hospitality – we were civilized, unlike the barbarians who had driven them to us.”
“Kindness.” The Aether tasted the word. “Yes. That is what they called you.”
“Lenis. She said it first.” I closed my eyes, though it made no difference in this place. “I met her when I was much younger, by the asphodels. She was gathering bulbs – her mother made salves for the dead, and the flowers that grew on graves were most potent. I was the youngest lictor, still learning to walk with dignity behind our king. She said I was too gentle for the work.”
“Were you?”
“I thought so then. I stepped around flowers instead of through them. I carried spiders outside rather than crushing them. I believed gentleness was a choice.” The bitter taste returned. “I know better now. Gentleness is just another word for weakness, and weakness is just another word for not yet tested.”
“Continue.”
“When spring came and these people from the seven hills prepared to leave, their leader approached our king with an offering. 'For your kindness,' he said, but his hands shook as he presented her. She was young, beautiful in their way, with eyes that never quite focused on what was in front of her. The vestal virgin, they called her. Sacred to their hearth goddess. A gift of gratitude.”
I paused, remembering how the others had looked at her – not with reverence, but with the careful distance men keep from wild animals.
“We should have seen it then. The way they hurried to leave once she was off their hands. The relief in their leader's voice when our king accepted her. But we were proud of our hospitality, pleased to have made friends of another tribe. The king gave her a place of honor, had the priests learn her rituals. Within a moon's turn, she had him listening to her every whisper.”
“And the whispers promised?”
“Power. She spoke of rituals from the old days, before the tribes scattered, when men could touch the forces that moved the world. She promised to make him more than mortal, to transform his twelve lictors into eternal guardians. Death itself would bow before us.”
The memory of that night pressed against me like deep water.
“It was summer solstice when she said the stars were right. She drew the zodiac in goat's blood on the flagstones – Scorpio, for death and rebirth. We twelve lictors were bound with rope to wooden stakes driven into the ground, forming the pattern she required. Our king stood at the center where the scorpion's heart would be. The ropes were symbolic, she said. The blood we gave – just drops from small cuts – would forge an eternal bond.”
“You trusted her.”
“We trusted our king. And he... he was exultant. As she chanted in languages that predated words, as our blood was dripped into the bronze vessel she had brought, he stood with arms raised, waiting for transformation.”
I could still see his face in those moments – ecstatic, confident, already seeing himself as divine.
“The ritual ended quietly. She spoke final words over the bronze jug, then poured it at the king's feet. The liquid hissed and steamed though the stones were cold. 'It is done,' she said. 'The transformation begins.' We were untied, confused. There was no thunder nor lightning, no sensation. It just ended. The king embraced her, called her the salvation of our people.”
“But?”
“Three nights later, he fell ill. A wasting sickness, the physicians said. Nothing they did helped – he simply... faded. Like water poured into sand. We twelve stood vigil as he died, and with his last breath, I felt something change in me. In all of us. The world became... sharper. Clearer. And infinitely more distant.”
“You became immortal.”
“We became severed. Cut from the natural flow of life and death. At first, we didn't understand. The witch – for that's what she was – took the throne as the king's ordained successor. She had documents, witnesses to his wishes. We served because lictors serve the throne, not the person.”
I felt the weight of decades in this place outside time.
“Years passed before we understood our curse. Small things first – wounds that healed too quickly, illnesses that couldn't take hold. Then larger things. My beloved...” The name still wouldn't come. “She aged as I did not. The years marked her with lines and grey while I remained frozen at twenty-seven summers. She wept for the children I could not give her, mourned the future we would never have. When she reached her fortieth year – still beautiful to me, still everything – she died apologizing for leaving me behind.”
“So you withdrew?”
“All twelve of us did. The weight of watching everyone we knew age and die while we continued... it broke us. We couldn't bear to see what our village was becoming under her rule – the festivals growing darker, the sacrifices growing larger, the joy bleeding away like color from old cloth. So we retreated to the necropolis, to live among the dead since we belonged neither with them nor the living.”
“Together?”
“Apart. Always apart. We couldn't bear each other's company – the shared shame, the reminder of what we'd become. Each took a different tomb, became guardians of nothing but our own grief. For years we existed like that, neither living nor dead, while she fed on our people like a patient spider.”
“And then?”
“Then she grew nervous. Perhaps she sensed our despair curdling into something else. Perhaps she simply wanted to remove witnesses to her deception. She told the villagers we had been corrupted by death, that we were dangerous. They came with torches and spears to grant us the peace we couldn't find ourselves.”
The memory of that night – the second catastrophe – threatened to overwhelm me even in this place beyond sensation.
“I ran. Like a coward, I ran. Behind me, I heard my brothers fighting. Heard them falling. Whether they died or whether they discovered, as I later did, that we heal from wounds that should kill – I don't know. I only know I ran through the darkness to the only place I could think of: that collection of huts on seven hills where the people who gave us the witch had gone.”
“Why there?”
“Because they had sheltered with us once. Because I thought...” I laughed, hollow and bitter. “I thought perhaps they would remember kindness. And perhaps, in their growing town, a man who couldn't die might find purpose again.”
“They did remember kindness – or at least the story of it. When I arrived at their growing settlement, footsore and wild-eyed, speaking their language poorly, they recognized something in me. 'You're from the coast,' their elder said. 'From the people who fed us in winter.' They took me to their king, and when I showed him the lictor's stance, the ceremonial movements, his eyes lit with recognition.”
The memory was less painful than the others, though it carried its own weight.
“Their town had grown in the decades since they'd fled to us. Seven hills slowly filling with houses, a wooden palisade, the beginnings of what might one day be called civilization. Their king was young, ambitious, trying to forge scattered families into something greater. He needed symbols of authority, traditions to bind his people. And here I stood – a living reminder of an older kingdom's power.”
“So you became his lictor.”
“His first true lictor. He had guards, of course, but I taught them to be more. Taught them the walk, the presence, the weight of representing royal authority. The king had eleven men join me, and I drilled them in the old ways. We became his symbol – twelve men who moved as one.”
I remembered the strange peace of those early years, having purpose again.
“For a time, it was... good. I had direction. The king valued my counsel, born from years of watching power function. The other lictors respected my knowledge. And then, one night, I woke screaming.”
I paused, remembering the horror of that moment.
“I thought an animal had crawled into my bed – something dead and rotting. But when I lit the lamp, I saw it was hair. My hair. All of it. From my head, my body, everywhere. It had fallen out in the night, leaving me smooth as a newborn. I sat there in my bed of fallen hair, understanding finally that whatever the ritual had done, my body had decided I was no longer truly alive.”
“The king found you?”
“Dawn came, and with it the king making his rounds. He saw me there, naked and hairless, surrounded by what I had been. I expected disgust, fear, expulsion. Instead, he called for his barber. 'If my finest lictor must be marked thus,' he said, 'then we shall all be marked.' He sat there in my quarters and had his head shaved clean, then commanded the other eleven to do the same. By noon, we twelve stood gleaming in the sun, the king's baldness making us all reflections of each other.”
The memory was one of the few that still brought warmth.
“'See how they stare,' the king said as we walked through the forum. 'They see strength in unity, not shame in difference.' He was right. The people whispered of our devotion, our discipline. Within a moon, young men were shaving their heads to look like the king's guard. My curse became Rome's fashion, my mark of death became a symbol of service.”
“But mortality has its own timeline.”
“Yes. That king died. Then his son. Then his son's son. And still I remained, unchanging. I learned to lie, to disappear, to reinvent myself. I would serve for a decade, then vanish to the countryside, then return as my own son. But after the third 'generation,' I couldn't bear it anymore.”
“You stopped serving?”
“I fled from purpose into pleasure. Told them my son had no interest in the lictor's life, that he would be a merchant instead. They believed it—why wouldn't they? I had wealth accumulated over lifetimes. I could afford to... experiment.”
The memory of those years tasted like stale wine and ash.
“I tried everything. Wine until I couldn't stand. Women until flesh became meaningless. Dice until I'd won and lost fortunes. I paid men to fight me, hoping pain would make me feel alive. I cut myself to watch the wounds heal, fascinated and horrified by my body's stubborn refusal to truly suffer. I ate until I was sick, starved until I should have died, poisoned myself with substances that would kill three men.”
“Nothing worked.”
“Nothing. The wine turned to water in my veins. The women blurred together, all aging while I remained frozen. The pain faded as quickly as it came. And through it all, the nightmares. Not of death—I would have welcomed those. But dreams of service. Of walking behind a king with purpose. Of being necessary.”
I remembered the lowest point, the moment that broke me.
“There was a night, deep in my third generation of indulgence. I'd paid for the most expensive courtesan in Rome, the finest wine, the purest lotus. I lay there in silk and gold, surrounded by beauty and pleasure, and felt... nothing. The woman asked why I was crying. I couldn't explain that I was mourning the man I'd been—a simple lictor who knew his place in the world.”
“So you returned to service?”
“I tried to die first. Properly, permanently. Threw myself on swords, drank every poison the Greeks had named. My body healed from everything, usually within days. The worst was drowning—I lay at the bottom of the Tiber for a full night before my lungs remembered they didn't actually need air anymore. When I crawled out at dawn, covered in river mud, I finally understood.”
“That death was denied you?”
“That purpose was all I had left. Without it, I was just... duration. Time passing through an unchanging vessel. So I invented one last identity—not a merchant's son returning to the family trade, but a veteran soldier seeking glory. Lucius Severus, who had fought in distant wars that existed only in my imagination. The legion welcomed experience, even experience built on lies.”
“And found purpose there?”
“I found the shadow of purpose. Following orders instead of giving counsel. Marching instead of processing. It wasn't the same, but it was better than the nothing I'd been living. Until they aimed us at my own coast. Until I led them through paths I'd walked as a living man. Until I brought Rome's iron to the place where I'd first learned to serve.”
My voice caught. Even in this place beyond flesh, I felt the tightness in my throat.
“I thought the village would be gone. Decades had passed. Surely the witch would have moved on, or died, or been overthrown. I thought I would find empty ruins, or strangers, or at worst some fading shadow of what had been. I did not expect...”
“Tell me what you found.”
“Celebration. As we approached through the hills at dusk, we could hear drums, see fires. I led my men through paths I could walk blind – through the necropolis, past tombs where I'd hidden from my own grief. The closer we came, the wronger it felt. The rhythm of the drums. The smell in the air. The quality of the screams – for there were screams, mixed with laughter.”
I forced myself to continue, to speak the horror into existence.
“In the central square where I had once stood guard behind a kind king, they were pulling a man apart. Not just any man – I recognized the insignia. One of my own scouts, still alive, still screaming. Ropes tied to his limbs, villagers hauling at each corner while the crowd cheered. His horse – I knew it was his by the legion brands – turned on a spit over the fire, somehow still kicking despite having no head.”
I forced myself to continue, to speak the horror complete.
“And on a throne of piled stones and bones sat... I almost didn't recognize her. The witch had become something monstrous. Where once she had been beautiful, now she was grotesque – a mountain of flesh spilling over her throne, rolls upon rolls of fat fed by decades of gorging. Her face, buried in her own excess, still held those terrible eyes, and when she laughed at the scout's agony, her chins wobbled like something boneless.”
“Your people had fed her.”
“Fed her, worshipped her, brought her everything she desired. She had grown fat not just on food but on their vitality itself. The villagers around her were gaunt, hollow-eyed, pouring their lives into this thing that had once worn beauty like a mask. Now the mask was gone, and only hunger remained.”
The memory pressed against me, too vivid even in this nowhere place.
“When the scout finally came apart – when his screams stopped and the crowd threw his pieces to the dogs – she pointed at another of my men they had captured. 'Bring him!' she commanded, her voice still honeyed despite the monstrous body it came from. 'The horses are so tender when they kick as they cook!'“
“So you acted.”
“My men saw demons feeding on Roman flesh. I saw my people reduced to worship of an abomination. When we fell upon them, there was no thought of mercy, no consideration of who might hide behind the masks. We were soldiers facing monsters, and soldiers know only one response to monsters.”
I remembered the weight of my gladius, the resistance of flesh, the spray of blood in firelight.
“I went for her. The witch. She saw me coming, recognized me even after so many years. She laughed – actually laughed – and called out in the old tongue: 'My faithful lictor returns! Come, join your brothers!' And that's when I saw them. Three of my fellow lictors, standing guard around her throne, as unchanged as I was.”
“They fought for her?”
“They were her. Hollowed out, will-less, moving with puppet grace. Whatever they had been, only the shells remained. I cut them down, and they fell without sound, without recognition. Just empty vessels serving an empty throne.”
The butchery that followed was not battle. It was extermination.
“We killed them all. Every man, woman, child. The old, the young, the sick, the strong. Roman discipline working through the night, methodical as a harvest. When dawn came, the square ran red, and we stacked bodies like cordwood. Only then, as the masks fell away, as the paint washed off in blood, did we see they were just people. Farmers. Fishermen. Children who had carved their own masks for a harvest celebration.”
“But the witch?”
“Was exactly what she appeared. When I finally reached her, she smiled with too many teeth and spoke in too many voices: 'You cannot kill what death has already refused.' So I didn't try. We bound her with ropes and iron chains, and I had my men pull her apart as they had pulled the scout. It took horses. It took most of the morning. She laughed until her head came free.”
“And after?”
“After, we burned everything. The bodies, the houses, the fields. Salted the earth for good measure, though I knew it was pointless. I took her head in a cloth and walked away from my legion, walked south to the sea.”
I felt the weight of it all, here in this place outside weight.
“Three days I wandered. Three days seeing their faces – not the painted dancers, but the people underneath. The boy with the goat mask. The old woman who had died trying to protect her granddaughter. The man who looked like my sister's son might have looked, if I'd lived to see him born. And I understood finally what I had become. Not a guardian of order, but its weapon. Not a protector, but a butcher who killed his own people because they had changed, or because I had, or because that's simply what weapons do.”
“At dawn, alone on the cliffs, I crushed her skull, burned the fragments, cast the ashes into the waves. Trying to undo what could not be undone. Trying to find an ending to a story that refused to end.”
“And so you came to this moment.”
“And so I came to the cliff's edge, ready to test whether a fall could succeed where spears had failed. Ready to be done with the weight of continuing.”
“Yet here you are.”
“Here I am. In this place that is not a place, speaking to a voice that claims to expect me. So I ask you, whatever you are – why? Why am I here? Why can't I die? Why must I continue when everything I touch turns to ash?”
The Aether was quiet for a moment that lasted forever.
“You think you were made by the witch,” the Aether finally spoke. “But she was merely the tool. You think you failed your people, but they were already lost. You think you are a weapon, but weapons have no choice in how they are used.”
“Then what am I?”
“You are a necessity. A finger on the scale when the balance tips too far. A gentle man who must sometimes do ungentile things to keep the river of fate from overflowing its banks.”
“I don't understand.”
“No. But you will serve anyway. Because that is what you are – a servant. Not to kings or witches or even to Rome, but to the flow of time itself. When mortals break the natural order, when they reach for powers that would unravel the pattern, you will be there to ensure the damage remains... contained.”
I thought of the witch's head, scattered as ash on the waves. Of my people, burned and salted into oblivion. Of patterns that might have spread if left unchecked.
“The witch knew immortality rituals,” I said slowly. “If she had taught others...”
“Yes.”
“And my people, if they had continued to feed her, to spread her corruption...”
“Yes.”
“So I was...”
“A necessity. As you will be again. And again. Until the river runs dry and time itself ends.”
I felt something settle into place, heavy as mountains.
“I don't want this.”
“Want is for mortals. You are something else now. Something required.”
“A gentle man doing ungentile things.”
“If that is how you must see it. Others will call you worse names. Or better ones. It matters nothing. What matters is that when the pattern threatens to break, you will be there to hold it. Through subtlety when possible. Through violence when necessary. Through centuries of thankless service to a flow you can barely perceive.”
“And if I refuse?”
“Then you will sit on cliffs for eternity, watching the waves and knowing that somewhere, the pattern unravels without you. That somewhere, another witch teaches another village to break reality. That somewhere, what you could prevent spreads like plague across the world.”
I closed my eyes that weren't eyes in this place that wasn't a place.
“I am just a man.”
“That is what you were. Now you are what necessity requires. The question is whether you will serve knowingly or continue to stumble through centuries believing yourself cursed rather than chosen.”
The weight of it – not curse but duty, not damnation but purpose – settled over me like a shroud.
“I will serve.”
“Yes. You will. And in time, you will understand why it must be you. Why gentleness matters more than strength. Why a man who steps around flowers is exactly what the river requires.”
“Where do I begin?”
“You have already begun. The witch is dead, her corruption burned away. Your people are gone, their danger with them. Now you must learn to see the patterns before they break. To act with precision rather than rage. To be the gentle hand that guides rather than the sword that cuts.”
“I know only how to serve kings.”
“Then serve the king of all things. Serve Time. Serve the flow. Serve the pattern that keeps the world from drowning in its own ambitions.”
I opened my eyes to find myself back on the cliff. The sun had moved. The waves still crashed below. But everything had changed.
I stood, no longer intending to jump. Somewhere, another pattern was forming. Somewhere, another mortal reached for power that would break the world. Somewhere, I was needed.
I began to walk, a gentle man with an ungentile purpose, carrying the weight of necessity across centuries yet to come.
Behind me, the waves washed the shore clean, as they always had, as they always would, until time itself ended and the river finally ran dry.
